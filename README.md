## File Structure 📂
Your project folder should look like this:

```
pong-arcade/
├── pongproject.py
├── ball.py
├── paddle.py
└── scoreboard.py
```

### File Descriptions:
- **pongproject.py**: The main game file where the game loop is controlled and the game is initialized.
- **ball.py**: Contains the `Ball` class, which manages the ball's movement and behavior.
- **paddle.py**: Contains the `Paddle` class for managing player paddle movements.
- **scoreboard.py**: Contains the `Scoreboard` class, which keeps track of the scores and displays them on the screen.

## How It Works ⚙️
- The game creates a window where two paddles and a ball are displayed.
- Players can control their paddles and try to hit the ball back and forth.
- The scoreboard updates automatically whenever a player misses the ball!
